About ".java" files

Build your own ".class" and ".jar" files on the command line with "javac" and 
"jar", or use the windowed "NetBeans IDE" which is packed with features.

You will need "Java's JDK" installed in order to develop in Java. When 
distributing, your clients will need "Java's JRE" in order to run your Java 
files.

Each "package" needs its own directory, so make folders as needed and put 
those files in those folders.
